Final Projects for Stats 363 (Experimental Design)
In this project, Saskia and I conducted experiments on the effect of 3 different treatments on the physical reaction between Coca Cola and Mentos. We utilize traditional ANOVA methods to estimate the treatment effect and find that Temperature is the most relevant treatment, followed by Type of Soda (Normal or Diet) and amount of Mentos.
